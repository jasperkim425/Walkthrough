# Day 0

## Task 1 | Introduction

Hi there - your security journey starts here!

The aim of this room is to give you a brief introduction to the technical aspects in Cyber Security by completing a single task every day for 25 days(you can do them at your own pace too). Each task is beginner friendly and assumes no prior knowledge about the specific topic. You'll be learning about the following topics:

- Web Application Security
- Network Security
- Scripting
- Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
- Defensive Security

After completing this room, you should have an idea about what particular areas of cyber security excite you.

Note: This room is inspired by a Christmas themed event we ran, so do not be alarmed with all the Christmas references!

## Task 2 | Get Connected

On TryHackMe you'll learn by deploying and hacking virtual machines

Lets deploy your AttackBox, a web-based machine used to attack other machines.

2. Deploy the machine shown on this task and wait 1 minute for it to configure.

3. Copy the IP of the machine that you deployed on this task.
